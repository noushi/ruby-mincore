- fstat() on each mincore() call is most probably overkill: we don't
   need to read file status just to know if it's empty or not a
   regular file
- Generate proper Ruby exceptions instead of perror/exit(1)
- Fix the documentation
- Find a better way to manage the gem: auto-increment version...
- Find a (more!) proper test case for cachedel 
- Integrate mincore functions fully in the File class : File.mincore
   should be an instance method operating on the file instance
